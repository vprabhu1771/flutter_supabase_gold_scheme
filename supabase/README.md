Designing a **Gold Scheme** database in **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** requires structuring tables to handle users, transactions, gold holdings, and plan details. Below is a structured approach:

âœ… Tracking each installment payment
âœ… Recording the gold price at the time of payment
âœ… Tracking accumulated gold holdings

### **How the System Works**
1. **User enrolls in a gold scheme** â†’ **`customer_subscriptions`**
2. **User makes installment payments** â†’ **`payments`**
    - Gold price at that time is recorded
    - Gold received is auto-calculated
3. **User's total gold is updated** â†’ **`gold_holdings`**

---

### **Example Data Flow**
#### **Payment Entry**
- User pays **â‚¹5,000** when the gold price is **â‚¹5,500/gm**
- The system calculates: **`gold_grams = 5000 / 5500 = 0.9091 gm`**
- The **`gold_holdings`** table updates their total gold balance.

---

### **Final Features**
âœ… **Each installment is recorded**  
âœ… **Gold price at payment time is stored**  
âœ… **Auto-calculates gold received per payment**  
âœ… **Tracks total gold holdings of a user**
